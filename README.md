This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: division by zero. The file 'bug.js' contains a function with the error, while 'bugSolution.js' provides a corrected version. The error occurs when the function receives zero as input for either 'a' or 'b', leading to a runtime error. The solution adds explicit checks for zero values and handles them appropriately, avoiding the error.
